## Project Overview
> Hey there, web developer! Congratulations on making it this far! 
> Here's your next project: `translating a mockup to HTML`. This is similar 
> to the exercise from earlier in the problem set, except this article is 
> going to be a bit more complicated. I'll be giving you a mockup of a website 
> (and a copy of the text in it). It's going to be your job to recreate it with HTML.
